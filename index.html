<h2>Project Specification</h2>
<p>
    In our Project we have the goal to provide a visualization for the OPTICS Clustering Algorithm.
    For a short introduction to the OPTICS algorithm see:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm">OPTICS algorithm - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a> <br/>
    The OPTICS algorithm was first published in: </p><br/>
    <p>Mihael Ankerst, Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Jörg Sander:
        "OPTICS: Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure."
        ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data. ACM Press. pp. 49–60. (1999)</p>
<p>
    The paper can be found online at: <br/>
    <a href="http://www.dbs.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/Publikationen/Papers/OPTICS.pdf">http://www.dbs.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/Publikationen/Papers/OPTICS.pdf</a>
</p>


<h3>Shortcomings of existing Visualizations</h3>
<p>
    There hardly exist in-depth visualizations for the OPTICS Algorithm despite the extensive referring to visualization
    in "OPTICS: Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure". Most of the visualizations we found are static
    depictions of clustering results, for the most part inspired by figures used for explaining the algorithm in the paper.
</p>
<p>Example of interactive visualization of the Algorithm:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kJjgowewOs">OPTICS Clustering Algorithm Simulation</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improving on existing Visualizations</h3>
<p>
    OPTICS builds upon an extension of the DBSCAN algorithm and is therefore part of the family of hierarchical clustering
    algorithms. It should be possible to draw inspiration from well established visualization techniques for DBSCAN and
    adapt them for the use with OPTICS.
</p>
<p>
    Our goal is to provide visualizations, that should ideally enable a user without prior knowledge of the algorithms
    to use it with input data provided by them. It should be possible to compare clustering results with several different
    combination of starting parameters with each other. Different visualizations should allow for a clear understanding of
    the achieved results.
</p>
<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p>
    In the course <a href="https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=052813&semester=2017S">052813 Scientific Data
    Management</a>
    OPTICS was taught by "schreibtischlauf"-assignments; Which means to run through the
    algorithm on a piece of paper by hand.

            bar being inserted into the histogram
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>
    This reachability plot in the form of a histogram is one way of visualizing the results of the OPTICS algorithm
    with strong reference to the datastructure operations used by the implementation of the algorithm.

<h2>Goals of this Project</h2>
<p>
    Our overall goal is to perform a <strong>Design study</strong> by implementing a visualization that improves on
    already existing visualizations of clustering algorithms and provides a way to interact with calculated clustering
    results through the meaningful combination of different visual representations of input and output data.
    To achieve this we aim to solve the following tasks:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Implement a visual representation of the OPTICS reachability plot</li>
    <li>Implement several visual representation of clustering results in 2D euclidean space</li>
    <li>Implement several 2D representation of the resulting cluster hierarchies</li>
    <li>Implement visualizations to compare the similarity of clustering results with different starting parameters</li>
    Possibly:
    <li>Provide a visual representation of the seed list used by OPTICS and how it is maintained by the
        algorithm</li>
    <li>Provide mechanics to reduce the dimensions of the provided feature vectors</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Achieving those goals should result in "application-like" visualizations of the OPTICS clustering algorithm, which
    allows for the exploration of cluster structures in user provided datasets.
</p>
<h2>Proposed Visualizations</h2>

<h3>2D euclidean Space</h3>
<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/clustering2DeuclideanSpace.png" alt="Clustering result in 2D euclidean space">
        <figcaption>Graph 1. - Clustering result in 2D euclidean space
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    This is the most often used visualization of clustering results in a 2-dimensional space. datapoints in a coordinate
    system are colored accordingly to their calculated cluster. It is easy to understand, even for users not familiar
    with clustering algorithms and represents what a User usually expects when handling two dimensional data. On the
    downside this visualization provides no information about how the results were achieved on its own. A User could
    assume that the clustering is part of the dataset or that any possible clustering algorithm was used.

</p>

<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/clustering2DreachabilityNet.png" alt="Clustering result in 2D euclidean space as reachability net">
        <figcaption>Graph 2. - Clustering result in 2D euclidean space as reachability net
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    By utilising the fact that OPTICS uses rangequeries to sort datapoints into corresponding clusters, it is possible to
    visualize the result as networks of reachability and therefore give rough illustration of cluster density.
    Using this visualisation with different parameters for the query range makes it possible to observe the effects of
    linkage and therefore has a high potential for visualizing cluster hierarchies when combined with interactive
    parameter adjustment. Users who are not familiar with the ideas of single-linkage clustering or rangequeries
    could be confused when confronted with lines in coordinate system they expect to show single points.
</p>

<h3>OPTICS Reachability Plot</h3>
<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/reachabilityWithParameterInput.png" alt="Reachability Plot with Parameter Input field">
        <figcaption>Graph 3. - Reachability Plot as a Histogram
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Illustrating the cluster-ordering by using a histogram as reachability plot is proposed in "OPTICS: Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure".
    Clusters are represented by "valleys" in the histogram; Subclusters are valleys in valleys. Not only does this visualization
    provide a easily human readable format for cluster-ordering and hierarchy it is also connected to the inner workings
    of the OPTICS algorithm. Users who are used to working with the OPTICS algorithm can draw conclusions on how to adjust
    the starting parameters by looking at this histogram.
</p>
<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/reachabilityWithParameterInput.png" alt="Reachability Plot with Parameter Input field">
        <figcaption>Graph 4. - Reachability Plot as a Histogram with interactive &epsilon; cut off
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Interactively assigning a new &epsilon;' smaller than the original &epsilon; by dragging a slider allows the
    User to discover all density-based clustering results. Moving the slider further down splits big clusters into their
    subclusters. For a meaningful visualizations this has to be linked with other graphs- most commonly with the
    Clustering result in a 2D euclidean space (Graph 1.)
</p>
<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/reachabilityPlotByAnkerstEtAl.PNG" alt="Illustration of the cluster-ordering">
        <figcaption>Fig3. - Illustration of the cluster-ordering used by Ankerst et.al.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<h3>Cluster Hierarchies</h3>

<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/dendrogram.png" alt="Dendrogram of Cluster hierarchy">
        <figcaption>Graph 5. - Dendrogram of Cluster hierarchy
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Dendrograms are tree diagrams to illustrate clusters produced by hierarchical clustering. A distance axis allows the
    User to see when a certain datapoint "joins" a cluster. It's similarity to genealogy illustrations (cladograms) makes it
    easy to interpret even when the meaning of this distance axis unknown to the User. That a possible interpretation of the
    distance axis isn't intuitiv is also it's biggest drawback.
</p>

<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/hierarchyGraph.png" alt="Graph of Cluster hierarchy">
        <figcaption>Graph 6. - Graph of Cluster hierarchy
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Results of hierarchical clustering can also be visualized as graphs. Nodes represent Clusters, which are made up of
    several sub-Nodes/-Clusters. This form of illustration is easily understandable without explanation or introduction.
    On the downside it holds very little information and its main advantage is in organizing a huge number subclusters.
</p>

<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/dendrogramDistanceMatrix.png" alt="Combining Dendrograms and a Heatmap">
        <figcaption>Graph 7. - Combining Dendrograms and a Heatmap (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23046142">https://stackoverflow.com/a/23046142</a>)
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    For datasets represented by a matrix of values it can be insightful to cluster columns and rows separated from each other.
    Combining the resulting dendrogram with a heatmap enables a User to look for associations between columns and rows by
    identifying patterns in the heatmap - often rectangular areas which share a color.
</p>

<h3>Similarity of Clustering Results</h3>

<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/comparingResults.png" alt="Comparing Clustering Results">
        <figcaption>Graph 8. - Comparing Clustering Results
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    When performing different clustering operations - possibly even by using different clustering algorithms - on the same
    dataset it is necessary to compare those results for similar information. The Jaccard similarity coefficient is often
    visualized by illustrating results as overlapping forms. The relationship between the area of overlap and the area of union
    can be interpreted as similarity between two clustering results. While easy to understand and interpret those visualizations
    can only communicate a limited amount of information and basically visualize a single coefficient between 0 and 1.
</p>


<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/comparingClusteringResults.png" alt="Comparing Clustering Results as barchart">
        <figcaption>Graph 9. - Comparing Clustering Results as barchart (Graphic by https://stackoverflow.com/a/23046142)
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    A simple barchart showing similarity coefficents for several algorithms runs compared to one specific clustering result
    gives a fast to grasp visualization of the similarity to a high number of other results and not just one. Still it's
    not possible to show similarity relationships between all results with each other, but the information density is greatly
    improved compared to Graph. 8.
</p>

<h3>Representig Clustering in Results in the original data</h3>

<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/datasetTable.png" alt="Excel-like table view">
        <figcaption>Graph 10. - input, edit and manage data
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    The most basic and common representation of datasets provided by Users are in the form of simple tables.
    Not only is it possible to provide multidimensional feature vectors like this. Many real world data is gathered or stored
    in form of comma seperated values. Most Users are already familiar with this format represented like this because of
    the widespread use of Spreadsheet software.
</p>

<div>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/singleGraphs/datasetTableColored.png" alt="Excel-like table view colored">
        <figcaption>Graph 11. - represent clustering results as spreadsheet overlay
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Ideally the clustering result could be used to sort or at least visually encode the detailed spreadsheet view.
    Possible comfort feature include to extract dendrogram- or clusterlables from this view to be used in other graphs.
</p>

<h2> Interface Design </h2>

<h3>Dashboard 1 </h3>
<p> This Dashboard consists of three Views. The Histogram View on the Bottom of the Page shows a Reachability-plot.
    This is a 2D plot, with the ordering of the points on the x-Axis and the reachability distance on the y-Axis.
    Because points belonging to a cluster have a low reachability distance to their nearest neighbor, the clusters show up as valleys in the reachability plot.  </p>

<p> The Bubble and the Network View provide a better Overview for the Distribution of the Clusters.
    </p>
<img src="img/Dashboard_1_Blasen_Netzdarstellung.png" alt="" width="700px">

<p> The Default Setting shows the Bubble and the Network View side by side, but it's also possible to enlarge one of the Views and hide the other.
    This can be done by using the View Choosing Buttons on the Top of the Page (see Arrow 1).</p>

<p> Another Interaction is to select specific Data in the Histogram via Brushing (see Arrow 3). The Data in the Bubble or Network View gets updated accordingly (see Arrow 2).
    This interaction allows a fine-grained Analysis of the Data. </p>

<p> It's also possible to adjust the two Parameters of the Optics Algorithm. Nearby Arrow 1 are two numerical Steppers to adjust the Parameters "Min pts" and "Epsilon".
    The Epsilon Value is used to set a maximal Distance to limit the Complexity of the Algorithm.
    The "Min pts" Value describes the number of Points required to form a Cluster.</p>

<img src="img/dashboard1_expanded_bubble_view.png" alt="" width="700px">

<h3>Dashboard 2 </h3>
<p> This Dashboard also consists of three Views.
    The Histogram View (Point 6) with the same Brushing Functionality as in Dashboard 1. <br />
    A Tree Map View (Point 4). <br />
    And a Graph View (Point 5). <br />
    The Option to adjust different Views (Point 2) and the numerical Steppers to adjust the Parameters of the Algorithm also stays the same as in Dashboard 1. <br />
    A new Functionality in this Dashboard is the Option to select whole Clusters to show or hide via a dropdown Menu (Point 1). This Functionality allows a finer selection
    in the Histogram View by excluding all points of a Cluster. </p>
<img src="img/dashboard2_details.png" alt="" width="700px">


<h3>Dashboard 3 </h3>
The third Dashboard is focused on showing how similar or not different Clusters are.
<img src="img/Dashboard_3.png" alt="" width="700px">

<p>
    The first View in this Dashboard (see Point 1) offers a comparison Function between two Clusters. The Clusters can be selected via two Dropdown Menus, that shows
    a list of all Clusters. The View shows the Similarity as a Number and as two Rectangles. The more the Rectangles are Overlapping, the higher is the Similarity between
    the selected Clusters. This Information is also displayed as a Number on the bottom of the View. The Value that Indicates the Similarity ranges from 0 (totally different)
    to 1 (the same), we decided to point this out by classify the Number with (Poor, Good, Excellent).
</p>
<p>
    The second View (see Point 2) offers a Search Function for similar Clusters. The User can select a Cluster via a Dropdown Menu and the View shows a List of all Clusters
    in descending order by their Similarity to the selected Cluster. The Similarity is expressed by the Length of a Line and the Value of the Similarity Index.
    We also plan to add a Tooltip to this Index Value, that explains it's meaning in more detail.
</p>
<p>
    The third View (see Point 5) shows an Overview of the Clusters in a Coordinate System. Different Clusters have different Colors.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth View (see Point 4) shows a Comparison between the Cluster Sizes as a Cake Diagram. The User can select the Clusters he want to compare via
    a Dropdown Menu (Selection of multiple or all Clusters is possible). This allows the User to get a fast Overview of the Cluster Sizes.
    We also think about a Selection Function in the third View that allows the Selection of specific Parts of a Cluster and shows the Distribution
    in the Cake Diagram.
</p>

<h2> Storyboards </h2>

<h3>Dashboard 1 - Insights in Students Performance </h3>
A university Professor named John Snow tries to make sense of the performance of his Students.
He creates a list with achieved assignment scores of for his courses..
He could try to spot possible groups of in student's performance by looking at the data in a spreadsheet, but that would be too time consuming.
<img src="img/dashboard1_expanded_bubble_view_epidemic analysis.png" alt="" width="700px">
<p>
    He imports his List as csv File and adjust the Epsilon and Minpts Parameters. At first he struggled a bit with the Meaning of this Variables, but by hovering over
    them a tooltip with a detailed explanation pops up.
    Then he decided that he just need the bubble View and enlarge this View by clicking on the View Selector Button on the top of the Page.
    After the Application draw all Points on the View, he realized that there are only few, but big Clusters on the Map.
    It seems that the clusters divide students in bad, average and good performing students.
    So he select specific Clusters by brushing over the Histogram, which results in a clearer and easier to read View of the better perfoming students.
    By adjusting the &epsilon;' slider he realizes that this cluster is made up of two subclusters.
</p>
<img src="img/Storyboard1/dashboard2_story.png" alt="" width="700px">
<p>
    In the Spreadsheet View the original name column with from his score spreadsheet is still accessible, but all the students
    are marked in the corresponding color of subclusters he selected by combining brushing and the &epsilon;' slider.
    After recognizing some names in each of the clusters Prof. Snow thinks that his good performing students are divided
    into full-time students and students who work part time in an IT-related field.
    He switches back to the bubble view and tries to find more clusters. Possible one or more with students who work in
    other fields.
</p>


<h3>Dashboard 2 - Finding Customers with a high Income that lives in a specific Street </h3>
<p>Frank, the Owner of a local Grocery Store wants to offer his Customers the Option of a 10 Minute Delivery, to compete with Amazon Fresh, that started recently in his City.
    Because a 10 Minute Delivery is not possible in the whole City, he plan to restrict his Offer to a specific Street.
    He also thinks that only People with a relatively high Income are willing to pay the Delivery Fee, so he want to limit his Marketing to these Kind of People.
    Thankfully he had a List with the Income and the Residence of all People of his City as Csv. The Problem is to evaluate the List by himself would take way too much time,
    so he decided to use our Application instead.
</p>
<img src="img/dashboard2_story.png" alt="" width="700px">
<p>
    At first he imports his List Data in our Application and adjust the Epsilon and Minpts Parameters. Like the Doctor before, the Tooltip Explanation help him to find
    the correct Settings. He decided to stick with the default View Settings that shows them Side by Side, because he need both. After analyzing the Tree View (Point 3),
    he decided to remove all Clusters with a low Income. He only select the Clusters with high Income over a Dropdown Menu (Point 4). The View updates and show the desired Results.
    Now he searches in the Table View (Point 5) after all Entries with the Street, where he plan to offer his Delivery Service.
    Because the Table View only Shows the Results of the selected Cluster, he can complete his search in no time.

<h2> Implementation Details </h2>

<h3>Javascript</h3>
<p> We will use Javascript as our Programming Language.
    We think its a good choice because there are many libraries and tools for building web Applications in this Language. </p>

<h3>Babel</h3>
<p> We will use Babel as a Preprocessor for our Js Code. This allows us to use ES6 Features(import/export, for of loops,...) and ensures that our Code will run in older Browser too.
</p>

<h3>Webpack</h3>
<p> We will use Webpack as Module Bundler.  So we can structure our Code in a clean way by modularize it.
    Webpack will then take care of stitching together all this modules (and their dependencies) into a single file in the correct order. </p>

<h3>D3</h3>
<p>Since D3 is the De-Facto-Standard for building Diagrams in Javascript, we decided to use it as our Tool of Choice. </p>

<h3>JsDoc</h3>
<p> To Document our Code we will use Jsdoc because it's very similar to Javadoc, a tool we already gained a lot of Experience with.</p>

<h3>npm</h3>
<p> To manage our Dependencies we will use the node package manager.
    We think this is a good choice because it's much easier to manage all our Dependencies in one Place.
    Npm will also take care of updating our Packages and warn us about deprecated Packages.</p>

<h3>node + express</h3>
<p> On the Server Side we will use node in Combination with express as Server. This Combination is very common and powerful for creating APIs.
It's also a benefit that we can manage our Dependencies with npm on Client- and Server-side. </p>

<h3>Jetbrains Webstorm</h3>
<p> As IDE we use Webstorm because it's especially designed for Web Development and very reliable and powerful.</p>
