<h2>Project Specification</h2>
<p>
    In our Project we have the Goal to Visualize the Performance of different Clustering Algorithms.
    The Algorithms we will analyze are k-means, DBSCAN and Optics.
    We expect a significant Programming effort for our Project, so we decided to realize it as a Technique Project.

    <!--
    Description of the target application, dataset, users, and task(s).
These descriptions should be detailed and specific. Give specific examples of user goals and the information & interactions the visualization tool must support in order to achieve those goals.
Explain why these goals are hard to accomplish with existing standard tools.
    -->
    The Application we create let the user choose a Clustering Algorithm and analyze different predefined Datasets.
    The User then can click through the Calculation Path of the Algorithm Step by Step and get a visual Feedback in Form of
    a Diagram that gets updated after each Step.
    We decided to use small Datasets because it's easier to Follow for a User what the Algorithm did.

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>
    <!--
     Brief description of your proposed solution. (At this stage just a short description and/or simple sketch is fine.
      You will develop this more for the proposal. However, a clear direction should be communicated.)
     -->
</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

    <!--
     A clear separation of tasks between the group members: you have to detail who did what for this milestone.
     -->
    <ul>
        <li>Setting up Website</li>
        <li>Creating a Mockup</li>
        <li>Explaining the Algorithms</li>
