<h2>Project Specification</h2>
<p>
    In our Project we have the goal to visualize the step-by-step functioning of different clustering algorithms.
    The algorithms we will analyze are K-means, DBSCAN and OPTICS.
    There already exist several visualizations of some of these algorithms on the web. For example:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/">Visualizing K-Means Clustering by
        Naftali Harris</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://stanford.edu/class/ee103/visualizations/kmeans/kmeans.html">Visualizing K-Means Clustering by
        Karanveer Mohan</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-dbscan-clustering/">Visualizing DBSCAN Clustering by
        Naftali Harris</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.irvingc.com/visualizing-dbscan">Visualizing DBSCAN on Spark by Irvind Cordova</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Shortcomings of existing Visualizations</h3>
<p>
    While those visualizations provide a good explanation of the abstract workings of those clustering algorithms
    (e.g. assigning points to clusters, recalculating the cluster centers, reassigning points ...)
    they don't provide a clear visualizations of the concrete step-by-step operations the algorithm performs to achieve
    its results.

    A good example of "showing but not explaining" is the
    <a href="https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-dbscan-clustering/"> visualization of DBSCAN by Naftali
        Harris</a>:
    While this visualization clearly indicates the use of "range queries" by drawing colored circles for every performed
    operation on a given point the viewer is not able to understand what a range query is and how it is calculated
    without consulting a textual description of the algorithm. The whole visualization seems more like a explanatory
    video
    for whích the user is able to choose from several different starting conditions.

    Additionally the provided visualizations for the K-means algorithm don't dive into the details of different
    initialization or update strategies. Both of which are implementation details, that can impact the performance and
    result quality of K-means in a significant way.
</p>
<h3>Improving on existing Visualizations</h3>
<p>
    The audience of already existing visualization examples seem to be users, who have already read about the workings
    and
    implementation specifications of the discussed algorithms, but have a hard time understanding the abstract concepts
    behind the performed calculations.
</p>
<p>
    Our goal is to provide visualizations, that should ideally enable a user without prior knowledge of the algorithms
    to implement them after interacting with our application. For this it is necessary to shift the focus away
    from the abstract concepts of the algorithms and visualize them step-by-step for small datasets. In contrast to
    existing visualizations all steps taken by the algorithms have to be made explicit to the user. Therefore we aim to
    provide a visualization much more like the exercises used to teach those algorithms to students, than a video-like
    representation of their abstract concepts.
</p>
<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p>
    In the course <a href="https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=052813&semester=2017S">052813 Scientific Data
    Management</a>
    the suggested algorithms where taught by "schreibtischlauf"-assignments; Which means to run through the
    algorithm on a piece of paper by hand.
</p>

        reachable points in yellow and noise points in blue. Wrong answers are annotated with red.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>
    For this it is necessary to visualize the algorithms using much less datapoints than used by the already existing
    visualizations. Ideally a user should be able to "calculate" the next step mentally and instantly verify their
    proposed solution by clicking a "Next Step"&#8209;button. This also requires the usage of a distance measure,
    which can be interpreted by a user without doing calculations by hand. Like shown in Fig1. the manhatten distance
    was used in the course Scientific Data Management, enabling students to measure the distance between two points by
    counting the gridlines between them.
</p>
<p>
    Another advantage of using a smaller set of data points is that the exercise can easily be edited by a user.
    By allowing editing the initial state with mouse interactions - e.g. clicking the gridlines of the coordinate
    system to add or remove points - a user can come up with their own exercise, breaking and creating new clusters
    with just a few mouse clicks. Showing the current dataset in json format using a textarea could enable users to
    easily share their generated exercises.

        bar being inserted into the histogram

<p>
    Additionally we would like to explore fitting and detailed visualizations for the range queries used in
    DBSCAN and Optics. Something existing visualizations seem to be lacking.

<h2>Goals of this Project</h2>
<p>
    Our overall goal is to perform a <strong>Design study</strong> by implementing a visualization that improves on
    already existing visualizations of clustering algorithms and provides a way to understand those algorithms by
    "follow-along-exercises" without the need to study their implementation details beforehand.
    To achieve this we aim to solve the following tasks:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>K-Means
        <ul>
            <li>Implement a visual representation of the K-Means algorithm</li>
            <li>Provide a visual explanation to different initialization strategies, which can stand on their own <br/>
                Possible strategies include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Random Partition</li>
                    <li>Forgy</li>
                    <li><a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6478-fast-and-provably-good-seedings-for-k-means">Fast and
                        Provably Good Seedings for k-Means</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement a visual representation of different iteration strategies without making their calculations
                implicit. <br/>
                Possible strategies include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lloyd</li>
                    <li>MacQueen</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>DBSCAN
        <ul>
            <li>Implement a visual step-by-step representation of the DBSCAN algorithm</li>
            <li>Implement a visual representation of neighborhood queries without making this procedure implicit</li>
            <li>Provide a way for the user to edit the initial dataset used for the algorithm run</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>OPTICS
        <ul>
            <li>Implement a visual step-by-step representation of the OPTICS algorithm</li>
            <li>Implement a visual representation of neighborhood queries without making this procedure implicit</li>
            <li>Provide a visual representation of the resulting histogram, which is filled "bar-by-bar"</li>
            <li>Provide a visual representation of the seed list used by OPTICS and how it is maintained by the
                algorithm
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Achieving those goals should result in "exercise-like" visualizations of clustering algorithms, that make every
    small step the algorithm performs explicit and thus can explain the algorithms in detail without requiring prior
    knowledge of the user or an excessive amount of textual explanation.

        algorithm
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>
    An <strong>additional goal</strong> to aim for - provided enough time - could be to expand the application for
    DBSCAN and/or OPTICS to be a true interactive version of the pen-and-paper of exercises of the course
    Scientific Data Management, allowing the user to propose a next step - e.g. marking a point as "core point",
    "reachable" or "noise point" for DBSCAN or adding a bar to the OPTICS histogram - and to get instant feedback if
    their choice was correct or wrong.
