<h2>Project Specification</h2>
<p>
    In our Project we have the goal to provide a visualization for the OPTICS Clustering Algorithm.
    For a short introduction to the OPTICS algorithm see:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm">OPTICS algorithm - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a> <br/>
    The OPTICS algorithm was first published in: </p>
    <p>Mihael Ankerst, Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Jörg Sander:
        "OPTICS: Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure."
        ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data. ACM Press. pp. 49–60. (1999)</p>
<p>
    The paper can be found online at: <br/>

</p>


<h3>Current Visualization Design</h3>

<img src="img/m3_design/m3_1.png" alt="" width="700px" style="border: 1px solid black;">
<p>
    Our Visualization is designed as a Single Page Application. In the Navigation Section we provide links to our Project Page (for more Information about our Ideas for the Visualization) and to our Github Page (for more Information about our Code).

    The Application itself is divided into two Sections. The „Config“ Section is the Place, were a User can upload his Data and adjust the Optics Algorithm by changing the Parameters Epsilon and MinPts.
</p>
<img src="img/m3_design/m3_2.png" alt="" width="700px" style="border: 1px solid black;">
<p>
The „Analyze“ Section is the Place, where the User can examine his inserted Data.

<h3>Iterating on use cases from milestone M2</h3>
<p>
    TODO
</p>

<h3>Difference between Low-Fi-Prototypes and Hi-Fi-Prototype</h3>
<p>
According to the suggestions we get on M2, we decided to make some major changes to our original design.
</p>
<p>
Our first change was the separation of inserting data and adjust the algorithm parameters from examining the algorithm results. So we separate this two tasks in a config page (inserting data and adjust the algorithm) and a analyze page(examining the algorithm results).
</p>
<p>
As suggested we abandoned the usage of drop down menus and use a histogram with a slider instead. According to the position of the slider (which represents the epsilon value) the histogram show the currently detected clusters in different colors. A horizontal line on the right side of the slider, which spans the whole length of the histogram, makes it easier to see, why the algorithm detects a cluster.
</p>
<p>
We mainly focused on using Dashboard 1 (Scatterplot, Histogram, Network Graph)from M2 for our design, but we replaced the network graph with a spreadsheet view of the algorithm results with colored rows, according to the cluster they belong to. This seems to be a better approach, because it provides a more in depth look at the cluster data.
</p>

<h2>Open Challenges and Problems</h2>
<h3>Dendrograms in d3</h3>
    <div>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/M3/RIdYg.png" alt="a dendrogram visualizing the cluster hierarchy">
            <figcaption>a dendrogram visualizing the cluster hierarchy
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
<p>M2 featured several visualizations utilizing cluster dendrograms. Unfortunatly there exist no easy to generate those
with d3. The suggestion most often found, advises to use a visualization similar to what we called Graph- or Tree-View
    in M2. Unfortunately this means to lose the information encoded by the single axis of a dendrogram, the &epsilon;-Axis.
While a tree view still perserves the information on cluster hirarchies, it is not possible to decide on a possible
    &epsilon;-cutoff with this form of visualization. An example of what is considered a dendrogram in the context of d3.js can
be found here:</p>

<h3>d3 and javascript bundler</h3>
<p>
    we encountered several unsolved problems regarding the d3-library and the usage of javascript bundler like Babel or Webpack.
    Relevant discussions can be found on Github:
</p>
<a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/issues/9">brush.on("end", handle) seems to get raw "mouseup" events</a> <br/>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Willmo36/9c13e3128dd628292252">d3-tip with browserify and webpack</a>

<p>While the problem with the d3-tip subpackaged seems to be solveable, the loose of brushing events still is a problem in our project
    and meant to exclude the feature of a brush-selection in the reachability plot for now. <br/>
    the d3-README states:</p>
<blockquote>
    # d3.event <br/>
    [...]<br/>
    If you use Babel, Webpack, or another ES6-to-ES5 bundler, be aware that the value of d3.event changes during an event! An import of d3.event must be a live binding, so you may need to configure the bundler to import from D3’s ES6 modules rather than from the generated UMD bundle; not all bundlers observe jsnext:main. Also beware of conflicts with the window.event global.
</blockquote>
